# Multiple Columns

You can divide your content into columns using two methods: either prescriptively, by setting a specific number of columns, or dynamically, by specifying the width of columns and allowing the browser to calculate how many columns will fit into the width of the parent element.

## Prescriptive Columns: column-count

The simplest way to divide your content into equally distributed columns is
to use the column-count property:

```
	E { column-count: columns; }
```

Real Example:

```
	.columns{
	  column-count: 3;
	}
```

## Dynamic Columns: column-width

Specify the width of each column, and the browser fills the parent element with as many columns as can fit along its width.

```
	E { column-width: length; }
```

Real Example:

```
	.column-width{
	  column-width: 200px;
	}
```

## Varying Distribution of Content Across Columns

By default, content thatâ€™s flowed into multiple columns will be balanced as equally as possible across the columns. If you want to change this default behavior, you can do so with the column-fill property.

```
	E { column-fill: keyword; }
```

**_Values_**

- Balance --Is the default value, tries to make all the columns equal length.
- Auto --Fills collumns sequentially. The content is flowed into the first column to fill the height and then into the next column until that one is filled, and so on.

```
	.varying-dist{
	  column-count: 3;
	  column-fill: auto;
	}
```

## Combining column-count and column-width

You can set both column-count and column-width properties on an element. If both properties are applied to the same element, the column-count value acts as a maximum.

```
	.columns {
	 column-count: 3;
	 column-width: 150px;
	}
```

Real Example:

```
	.count-width{
	  columns: 150px 4;
	}
```

## Column Gaps and Rules

The browser place a default 1em gap between each column. However, we can alter that default and specify our own distances by using: column-gap and column-rule.

### Column Gap

Sets the space between columns

```
	E { column-gap: length; }
```

### Column Rule

column-rule property draws a line between columns.

```
	E {
	 column-rule-width: length;
	 column-rule-style: border-style;
	 column-rule-color: color;
	 column-rule: length border-style color;
	}
```

## Column span

Allows to span ceratin elements in multiple columns.

```
	.span{
	  column-span: all;
	}
```

## Containing Elements Within Columns

There's no role to help us to aling an element within the columns, but, we can set the element, or in this case the image, a max width 100% to avoid collision with the other columns

```
	.image{
	  border: solid 1px black;
	  columns: 3;
	  height: 200px;
	  width: 800px;
	  margin-bottom: 40px;
	  margin-left: 10px;
	}

	img{
	  max-width: 100%;
	}
```
